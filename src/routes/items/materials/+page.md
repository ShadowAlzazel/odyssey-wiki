### Upgrading and Smithing

Most Odyssey materials are upgraded at a Smithing Table using either iron or diamond as the base. To apply the upgrade, you'll need the appropriate [Smithing Upgrade Template](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Smithing_Template) along with the tool or armor piece in the [Smithing Table](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Smithing_Table).
