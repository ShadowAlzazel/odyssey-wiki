# What are Weapon Parts

Each weapon has some parts, like the blade or hilt, that can be customized using a pattern. 
You can choose any upgrade template with any pattern. As such each pattern has is like a **set** of all the parts.

You use the template + item + pattern in the smithing table. 

Currently, there are up to 4 parts that a weapon can be customized on.

Some weapons only have 2-3 parts that can customized.

You can also duplicate existing part patterns, so it is best to go out and explore or trade with other players for the part pattern.
