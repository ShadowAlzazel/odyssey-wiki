# Tome Introduction

Odyssey introduces a powerful set of magical items known as *Tomes*, which expand and enhance the enchanting experience far beyond vanilla capabilities.

**Tomes** are specialized tools designed to give players finer control over enchantments, allowing for customization, optimization, and even curse removal. With strategic use, tomes can significantly enhance gear progression and offer new solutions to previously irreversible enchantment issues.

The **Blank Tome** is the foundational item used to acquire all other tomes. It is craftable and acts as the base material required for generating specific tomes through the enchantment table.

## How to Obtain Tomes

To create a tome, place a **Blank Tome** into an **Enchantment Table**. Depending on the enchantment table cost (determined by the lapis cost and the level cost), different tomes may become available. Each tome is tied to a specific cost level, so progression is necessary to unlock more advanced tomes.

### Using Tomes

Use the tome in the first slot of the smithing table, along with the tool and a lapis.
