## Balance Considerations

### High-Power Enchantments
Some enchantments are particularly powerful and may need careful consideration:
- **Fealty**: Keeping items on death is extremely valuable
- **Gravity Well**: Black hole effects can be game-changing
- **Swap**: Instant teleportation has many applications
- **Untouchable**: Extended invulnerability affects combat timing

### Scaling Enchantments
Many Odyssey enchantments scale linearly with level, making higher levels significantly more powerful:
- Percentage-based bonuses (most damage and protection effects)
- Duration-based effects (status effect timers)
- Quantity-based effects (number of projectiles, charges, etc.)

### Curse Balancing
The custom curses provide interesting trade-offs:
- **Encumbering Curse**: Higher gravity but could be useful for specific builds
- **Parasitic Curse**: Risk/reward mechanic for powerful items

This documentation should serve as a comprehensive reference for all enchantments in your system. Each enchantment's formula is clearly displayed, showing exactly how the effects scale with enchantment level.
