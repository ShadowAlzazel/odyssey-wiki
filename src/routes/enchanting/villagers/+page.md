# Villager Trade Rebalance

Since the librarian villager trading system has been completely rebalanced to encourage exploration and strategic trading in the [Trade Rebalance Update](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Villager_Trade_Rebalance), Odyssey uses this feature to add more enchantments to the villager pool.

## Overview

Instead of every librarian offering access to all enchantments, each librarian now has a **specialized inventory** of enchanted books based on their **biome of origin**.

### Key Changes

* **Biome-Specific Enchantments**: Librarians now sell enchantments themed around their home biome.
* **Book Rarity System**:

  * **Common Books**: Available from novice and up. These offer enchantments with **randomized levels**, similar to vanilla behavior.
  * **Special Books**: Only available from **Master-level librarians**, and always come at a **fixed, optimal level**.
* This system adds flavor, progression, and locality to trading, rewarding players who explore the world and interact with diverse villages.

**Note:** Each biome has its own curated list of enchantments. Special books are exclusive to that biome and librarian level.
